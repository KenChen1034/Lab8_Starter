# Lab 8 - Starter

1) For my team, our automated tests for the recipe project will be set within Github to make sure our software is function correctly. I might also do some test in my own local environment.
2) No, I will not use E2E testing to test a single function. It is use to test the entire work flow the software.
3) I would not use an unit test to test the "message" feature of a messaging application. The idea of sending a message is more complicated. The message send can be an image, words or emoji. An unit test to test all these things is too much for an unit test.
4) I would use an unit test to test max message length feature of a messaging application. It is a simple task about limiting the character to be under 80 characters.
